JaRE - Java Rule Engine

Pentaho PDI Plugin Step

JaRE is a Java based tool to check data against rules. This allows to separate
the ETL logic from the business logic. When the business logic changes the ETL
logic does not have to change. This is a positive factor for quality. Keeping
the logic external to the programming logic is also more transparent for the users.

There is a web application available which allows the user to easily define
rules, group of rules and actions. These can be connected with "and"/"or" logic
to a complex data validation task.

The rule engine can be used to check data for consistency, correctness and quality. Also
useful for filtering data and certain data mining tasks.

The plugin step allows to check the data used in a transformation against the rules
produced by the Business Rules Maintenance web application.

The business rule engine is published as open source. Sources are available
on  github/uwegeercken.
