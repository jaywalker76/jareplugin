Jare - Java Business Rule Engine

Pentaho PDI Plugin Step

Java based tool to check data from a file or database against rules
which are defined in XML files. Rules are reusable, avoid duplication
and thus are a positive factor for quality. Rules can be connected with
and/or logic to a complex data validation task.

Can be used to check data for consistency, correctness and quality. Also
useful for data mining, to find out the occurrence of certain data.

Rules can be defined in one or multiple rules files in one folder or
can be zipped into an archive that the rule engine uses.

Read the documentation PDF file for detailed information.

The Business Rules Maintenance Web Tool allows users to easily define rules
and complex logic through a simple web interface without any coding.

The business rule engine is published as open source. Sources are available
on the web page.
