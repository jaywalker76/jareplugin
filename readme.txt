Jare - Java Business Rule Engine

Pentaho PDI Plugin Step

Regular Plugin Step for the Pentaho Data Integration Tool (PDI).

The Rule Engine is a java based tool to check data from a file or database
against rules which are collected in a zip file. Rules are reusable, avoid
duplication and thus are a positive factor for quality. Rules can be connected
with and/or logic to a complex data validation task.

Because the rules are defined externally, the transformation or job does not
need to change when the business rules change. The business rules can be defined
and maintained by the business user. This increases the transparency of the logic to
the user as it is no more embedded in IT code.

The rule engine can be used to check data for consistency, correctness and quality
or for filtering data. Based on the results of the rules, one or multiple actions
may be executed that modify the data.

A web application is available to easily define complex rules and actions and group
them into projects. This allows to quickly and easily define groups of rules
defining the logic for different projects.

Read the documentation PDF file for detailed information on the Java Business Rule Engine.

The business rule engine is published as open source. Sources are available
on github.
